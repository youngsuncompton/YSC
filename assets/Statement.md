I was born in the middle of the summer in the middle of New York City. The middle
child of a lower middle-class family whose earliest memories are of dog days spent
outdoorsâ€”exploring and wondering. At a young age I became enamored by the
natural world and would collect field guides on plants, animals and geology. In school
I would read what I had to while copying the illustrations and diagrams that
accompanied those texts. I learned early on how text and image in tandem helped me
better understand the world around me. My parents labeled me a curious child and
now grown I find myself interested in many things, of which design sits
comfortably at the peak. I try to link my interests by design. Literature and philosophy.
Science and art. Reason and myth. All aspects of humanity and thought shadowed by
design as means for their translation and dissemination.

What influences me the most within and outside of design are writings, works and
artifacts that deal with interdisciplinary at their core. I am drawn to the work and
sensibilities of the Winterhouse Studio and Institute; Kenya Hara and his philosophy of
emptiness; the texts of poet-typographer Robert Bringhurst; Ellen Lupton and Abbot Miller
and Design Writing Research and its concern with theory, media and history of Graphic Design;
Stuart Bailey and his selfreflexive publication Dot Dot Dot; the literary, critical and academic works 
of Italo Calvino; those grand ideas and integrities of R. Buckminster Fuller; and the lively story
telling and films of Wes Anderson. It is through their works of that I find the greatest
potential and promise in design. I find that design is not typically seen as a practice
with focus on reflection. Instead methods of thinking-by-doing dominate the field,
resulting in a struggle to meet the current/future needs of graphic design.

Like in my youth, the time I spent earning my undergraduate degree was one of
research and exploration. I made sure my chosen projects would require more than an
eye for design but also compelled research and understanding of a new topic. I used
elective credits to take courses in geology and earth science to pursue my childhood
interests and natural curiosities. I have taken this time following my graduation to
gauge the field in a more real way. Real in the sense of how to do business and how to
deal with clients; how to not merely abide by a clients rationale but to engage and
partake in the process of creating a brand, website or promotional piece by design
thinking instead.

My reasons for applying to the Maryland Institute College of Art are selfish ones I must admit mainly
because of what I know about the school and its educators as purveyors of
extraordinary competence and quality. My aim is to take what I have learned, as a
child, young adult, undergraduate student and professional and work to focus my
intentions and methodology. I am not through exploring, examining and questioning
the field of design and its greater implications; economically, politically, socially
and environmentally.
