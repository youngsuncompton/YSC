Poster, invitation, program announcing debut of _Kjell The√∏ry_ an augmented reality performance by provisional collective Anatomical Theatres of Mixed Reality ([ATOM-r](http://atom-r.com)) juxtaposeing Alan Turing's mathematical descriptions of nature with algorithmic mutations of Guillaume Apollinaire's 1917 play _The Breasts of Teresias_, a genderfluid spectacle for which the author invented the word "surrealism."
