# Seventeen-day Studio


The [Seventeen-day Studio](http://svntn.com) began on March 29, 2013 and closed seventeen days later on April 14. We formed the studio as an exploration in collaboration, and exhibition of the design process (by pairing performance and/as publishing), and an evaluation of the field as we knew it. What came from it greatly outweighs what we put into it, due to the kindness and generosity of our colleagues, advisors and those that stopped to chat.

Designed and developed with [Javier Lopez](http://javierdesigns.info/) and [Luiz Ludwig](http://www.luizludwig.com.br/)
